# BMI-Calculator
Python application to check your health

The body mass index (BMI) measures your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.

If your BMI is:
- below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range
- between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range
- between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range
- 30 or over – you're in the obese range
